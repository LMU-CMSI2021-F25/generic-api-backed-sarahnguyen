This application is built to help you discover recipe that you can possibly make with ingredients you already have. If you have an ingredient, and you don't know what to make - this app is designed for you! 

The user can type an ingredient; for example, "chicken," or "tofu", and the app will generate the recipe matching with it. The app will show a simple visual of the dish with the name for the user to get inspiration.

I used TheMealDB, which is a free recipe database with a simple API. Here is the link to the API doc: https://www.themealdb.com/api.php. In this app I use the “Filter by Ingredient” API. 

In this application, I am proud to use all of the code from the vanilla web app again, and apply it to this assignment. I found it is interested to apply the click button again to generate the information that I need. I am still new with coding, so when there is a part I have to do extract API. I have to ask AI how to create a new API extract, and they showed me how to fetch it. Overall, I learnt a lot from this assignment.
